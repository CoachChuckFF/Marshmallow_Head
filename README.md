# DMX Controlled Marshmellow Head

The head uses an esp32 programmed with esp idf and the ardino core. The arduinop core is only used to enable the fast led library. For future reference I am using commit 4b91c82c of the esp-idf. The wireless controller I am using is the Blizzard Wizzard mobile artnet controller.

# Materials

* Head base - 12"x12" vase/cylinder (try to get polycarbonate) 
* LEDs - 12V 60 leds/M - 10m
* Hot Glue
* Black door screen (Home improvement store) - as ridged as possible
* Black window tint (auto store)
* Flat white primer spray paint
* Glossy white spray paint
* Clear high glossy protectant spray
* Hardhat
* Power source - 10A 12V (look at emergency car jumpers)
* ESP32
* EVA Foam - 1/4" ~ 1/2" thickness
* Thin but ridged foam board 

# Build

## Head Cutout
* use tools/mellow_print.pdf to draw outline
* use jigsaw with appropriate blade

## Eyemesh
* cutout 2 screens for each hole in head 
* sandwich the window tint inbetween the two screens
* hot glue edges together  

## Bottom Ring
* use ridged thin foam for bottom ring

# Notes

## This is not a trivial build
* I spend around $600 (I made some expensive mistakes)
* It took 50+ hours
* Its still not perfect (or close)

## Painting is tough
* Take your time
* Glossy clear coat enamel will eat your paint

## Check Connections often
* You don't want to be half done and realise it does not work

## Use polycarbonate instead of acrylic
* Acrylic is a pain in the butt to work with
* Acrylic is brittle
* When cutting acrylic use painters tape to help with cracking

## Don't go glue crazy
* Make sure all connections are good and you are happy with end result before going glue crazy
* If you prematurely go glue crazy denatured alcohol will be your friend

## Pay attention to spacing
* Cut mesh eyes and mouth as small as possible to maximize pixel density
* Layout pixels before cutting and gluing

## Clean before you paint
* If you make markings for spacing (use permanent marker) make sure to clean them off
* Marking will be visible under paint
* Use alcohol to wipe them off
