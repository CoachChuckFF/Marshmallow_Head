# DMX Controlled Marshmellow Head

The head uses an esp32 programmed with esp idf and the ardino core. The arduinop core is only used to enable the fast led library. For future reference I am using commit 4b91c82c of the esp-idf. The wireless controller I am using is the Blizzard Wizzard mobile artnet controller.

# Notes

## This is not a trivial build
I spend around $600 (I made some expensive mistakes)
It took 50+ hours
Its still not perfect (or close)

## Painting is tough
Take your time
Glossy clear coat enamel will eat your paint

## Check Connections often
